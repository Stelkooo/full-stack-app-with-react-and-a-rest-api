<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://github.com/Stelkooo/full-stack-app-with-react-and-a-rest-api/blob/main/client/public/screenshot.png)

In this **Treehouse Tech Degree** project I created a React App to display a courses databases with REST API, which I created in a previous project.

This full stack app allows users to view the courses without a user account. Basic Auth is used to login and access further functions such as creating a new course, editing a course, and deleting a course but only editing/deleting a course can only be done if you own the course.

I created this project with my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

The project is hosted on Railway.
