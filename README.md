# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

![Screenshot of site](https://github.com/Stelkooo/full-stack-app-with-react-and-a-rest-api/blob/main/client/public/screenshot.png)
In this **Treehouse Tech Degree** project I created a React App to display a courses databases with REST API, which I created in a previous project.

This full stack app allows users to view the courses without a user account. Basic Auth is used to login and access further functions such as creating a new course, editing a course, and deleting a course but only editing/deleting a course can only be done if you own the course.

I created this project with my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool, I:

- Used Javascript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular manner
- Used React Router to set up my routes
- Used Fetch API to fetch data from my REST API
- Allowed users to sign up and login via Basic Auth
